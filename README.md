# Small-Logisic-Regression-SUV-data
Good starting point showing the breakdown of logistic regression on a small dataset to predict SUV purchase data.
This is an extension of the SUV data logistic regression analysis listed [here](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/suv-purchase-prediction-using-logistic-regression-ca79bae6f3d5).
What you will see in this rendition is an implementation of a larger confussion matrix, indexing of columns, adding new columns, and an explination regarding __why we might want 
explore the splitting of the data based on a larger confusion matrix__. This also explores the use of the multilabel confussion matrix that is part of the sklearn package. I look 
to expand on this using larger datasets and feature selection options.
